# Nginx Docker-compose Template

This is a simple yet effective nginx site deployed with 
docker-compose. It serves on port 80 and displays index.html
in the /src folder. The port can be changed on [line 5](https://github.com/voidarclabs/docker.nginx/blob/main/docker-compose.yml#L5)
of docker-compose.yml. 

To run the container, simply type `docker-compose up -d`.
